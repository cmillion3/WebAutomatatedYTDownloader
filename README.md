# WebAutomatatedYTDownloader
Python program that prompts the user to enter a YT link, and downloads it to their computer. 
PLEASE READ! 
MUST HAVE CHROME INSTALLED TO USE, PLANS TO USE OTHER BROWSERS IN THE FUTURE

How to use: 
RUN THE "AUTOYTDL.EXE" AND PASTE THE YOUTUBE LINK, CHOOSE BETWEEN 720P AND 420P THE PROGRAM WILL OPEN CHROME AND DOWNLOAD YOUR VIDEO. 
THIS SAVES PEOPLE TIME DOING IT THEMSELVES AND AUTOMATES THE PROCESS.
